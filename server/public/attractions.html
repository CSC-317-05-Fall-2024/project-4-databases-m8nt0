                <p>A palace indeed, this art gallery is now a member of the National Register of Historic Places. It stands on the edge of a shimmering lake, where ducks and snow white swans roam and old-growth trees dot the shoreline. You could spend hours admiring the elegant neoclassical facade of the Beaux arts palace along with the surrounding archways and columns. Time your visit to coincide with an arts event to bring your experience to the next level.</p>

                <p>If you're looking to take in some patented California sunshine while in San Fran, Golden Gate Park is the place to go. Once a collection of rolling dunes, the lush landscape and cultural creations leave few reminders of its humble beginnings. Golden Gate Park harbors a collection of winding walking paths, glorious lawns, over 5,000 unique plants and several museums. Whether you're looking for a cute date or gathering with family, the wide open lawns are great for a picnic. Meanwhile, the de Young Museum, Steinhart Aquarium, and the California Academy of Sciences promise to invigorate the senses.</p>
